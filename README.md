# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Giving values to the point x1 and x2.
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the points y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula.
### Step 4: 
Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5: 
At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
~~~

a=4
b=10
c=2
d=6
dist=((b-a)**2+(d-c)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(dist))
~~~
