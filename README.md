# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

 ## Step 1:
 
 Giving values to the point x1 and x2.
 
 ## Step 2:
 
 Giving values to the points y1 and y2
 
 ## Step 3:
 
 Substitute the values in the distance formula 
 
 ## Step 4:
 
 Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple

 ## Step 5:
 
 At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
~~~python

 a=4
 b=10
 c=2
 d=6
 dist=((b-a)**2+(d-c)**2)**(1/2)
 print("{:0.2f}".format(dist)
